# Function for exercise prediction
The function is supposed to predict exercises on sensor data. The sensor data will be sent to the Raspberry Pi and saved as a csv file, the function will then read the raw data and preprocess it so that the model can make a predictions on it. When a prediction has been made a message containing the type of exercise, the probability of the prediction and the amount of repetitions is sent back to a mobile device.
